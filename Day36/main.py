## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price. 

current_date = date.today()

	"function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED",
	"symbol": STOCK,
	"apikey": stock_api_key,
}

stocks_response.raise_for_status()
stocks_data = stocks_response.json()
today_open_stock = stocks_data["Time Series (Daily)"]
print(today_open_stock)

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator

#get the current date using datetime

news_params={
	"from": current_date,
	"to": current_date,
	"q": COMPANY_NAME,
#	"apiKey": news_api_key,
	"apiKey": "dc5ea2ffd0ff47c9b73e32fc5939e3e9"

news_data = news_response.json()
articles = []
for i in range(0,3):
	articles.append(news_data["articles"][i]["title"])
print (articles)

print (current_date)

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.
