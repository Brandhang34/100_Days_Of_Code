## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price. 

current_date = str(date.today())
previous_day_date = str(date.today() - timedelta(days=5))
day_before_previous_day_date = str(date.today() - timedelta(days=6))

print(current_date)
print(previous_day_date)

	"function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED",
	"symbol": STOCK,
	"apikey": stock_api_key,

yesterday_closing_stock = float(stocks_data["Time Series (Daily)"][previous_day_date]["4. close"])
day_before_yesterday_closing_stock = float(stocks_data["Time Series (Daily)"][day_before_previous_day_date]["4. close"])

price_diff = yesterday_closing_stock - day_before_yesterday_closing_stock

percentage = round((price_diff/yesterday_closing_stock)  * 100, 2)

print("percentage" , percentage)

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator

#get the current date using datetime
if percentage > 5 or percentage < -5:
	articles = getArticles()
	sendMessage(articles, percentage)
## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.

#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
