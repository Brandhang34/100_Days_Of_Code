# 100_Days_Of_Code

This is my github repo for the udemy course: 
['100_Days_Of_Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023'](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
offered by "Dr. Angela Yu".

Each day contains at least some form of python code from the projects created throughout each section.

Although I already have a beginner-intermediate level of coding background, 
I wanted to be able to review and have some form of refresher. Python is great
especially for cloud computing, so being able to adopt the language will be extremely
valueable to my skillset.
